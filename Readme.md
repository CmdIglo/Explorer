# Explorer 

This project is aiming to build an interface for easier cross-computer work

Goal of this project is, to build a desktop app, that serves as a file explorer
that automatically saves the work done in the directories to a database, so that
you can login to your account on another device and continue working in that 
directory, where all your progress is saved. It's basically yet another
platform, that works on the repository-kind-concept, but made easier, as you will
be able to just drag and drop files into your projects' directory and work in the
directory, like you are used to from your windows/linux/macos/etc. GUIs. So it's
github made simple
